## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses Python 3.x and relies on a virtual environment (`venv`) for dependency management.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [Your Git Repository URL]
cd [Your-Project-Folder-Name]
```

### 2. Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚠️ A Note on PyTorch Installation

This project uses `pytorch`. The `requirements.txt` file might install a **CPU-only** version of PyTorch by default.

If you require **GPU (CUDA) support**, it is strongly recommended that you install the correct PyTorch version manually *before* or *after* running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Please visit the [Official PyTorch Website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the correct command for your specific environment (OS, Package Manager, CUDA version).

*Example command for CUDA 11.8:*
```bash
# You can run this before installing the other requirements
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118)
```
